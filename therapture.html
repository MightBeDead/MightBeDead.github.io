        <h1>The Rapture</h1>
	<p>
	The successor to the Go, the Oculus Quest. The Quest was the first true wireless VR experience with the oculus go having a little dingus thing for a controller and the quest having gen2 touch controllers like the rift s, the oculus go was meant for tame stuff like tours and looking around in simulated places the quest was a full blown wireless rift and at the time it was incredible.
	</p>
	<p>
	It was boasting dual OLED 1440 x 1600 panels at 72hz which was understandable for a system of its calibre it was a hard working machine and it proved it many times but it definitely didnt come without flaws of which it had many.
	</p>
	<p>
	Because of its size and it power it would get quite hot and being smaller system means no fans or cooling on board which lead to quests having blurry panels due to heat and laggier gameplay due to the heat produced.
	</p>
	<p>
	Basically it got too hot thanks to all the bunched up electronics in the front but for a first try into a wireless rift variant of the headset line it was really good perhaps, too good...
	</p>
	<p>
	Oculus or rather Facebook Technologies got a taste of the success that came with the Quest and decided they wanted more and looked into expanding the Quest more and ditching their flagship headset a sad day for many as they would spend the next year developing their next headset and from now on the name Rift is old news.
	</p>
	<p>
	Flash forward one year into 2020 specifically October, the headset that had been in development for year was released the Oculus Quest 2. For now im going to highlight why its a great device... for now.
	</p>
	<p>
	This headset is amazing for what its good at being a headset for people with no computer to do the heavy lifting of running games and it has extensive library of games to pick from with some being straight up games from the Rift not to mention it was super powerful running games at 90 frames with dual 1832 x 1920 LCD panels at 120hz, got damn Oculus!!! thats some power right there. Not to mention it was cheaper than the original Quest with more storage built in and 6gb of memory, christ almighty this thing is so good!!! and intoduced hand tracking, no controllers just hands.
	</p>
	<p>
	Now you're probably wondering why i despise this thing so much after i just praised its existance, my problem is with Facebook Technologies priorities with the Quest and how they are toying with the Oculus brand by completely phasing out production of pcvr headsets.
	</p>
	<p>
	Why i call this the rapture is because of what happened with it release it has pcvr functionality but at the price of a cable that over $100 bones so that meant that pcvr with this thing was less popular than just y'know using it naturally, meaning it phased out pcvr with oculus almost immediatly and replaced it with wireless vr which is great for technology in the future go you but again the priorities of Facebook with this device are flawed and if you peel back the skin this device is a giant ad.
	</p>
	<p>
	the Quest 2 upon turning it on you will be greeted with a make your account page for facebook, YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCOUNT TO USE THIS HEADSET you absoluelty have too and if you dont enjoy your $400 dollar paper weight, and even worse a large majority of the consumers of the Quest are little kids who want a vr headset but dont have a chunky pc to run it with but the minimum age to join Facebook is 13 so there were hundreds of accounts created by those kids that upon creation were disabled and locked meaning little timmy's new Quest is deadzo, absoluetly pathetic.
