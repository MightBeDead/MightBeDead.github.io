        <h1>The Beginning</h1>
	<p>
	Oculus is a VR company who develop VR technology and things in the same line as VR. They have been a huge competitor in the virtual reality scene since they practically revived virtual reality from all the failed attempts in the past.
	</p> 
	<p>
	The Oculus Development kit 1 (DK1) released in march of 2013 and was revolutionary for VR boasting a 1200 x 800 Resolution LCD display which at the time was pretty damn good it also had a 60hz refresh rate pretty standard for the time all in all was the beginning of something new.
	</p>
	<p>
	Following a year later was the DK1’s older brother the Development Kit 2 (DK2) and really upped the ante with a way more incredible 1920 x 1080 OLED panel display which was common standard for most screens at the time and still is but for the time was really good with an improved 75hz refresh rate and all new dedicated HDMI and USB 2.0 support which was a far cry from the DK1’s measly VGA connectivity.
	</p>
	<p>
	After the DK2 oculus spent the next few years  developing their next headset whilst the new unrevealed competition developed their own, releasing in march of 2016 the Oculus Rift CV1 was released to the masses and was in my opinion the first truly great VR headset with all new motion tracked controllers and room scale tracking due to the new IR sensors packed with the headset meaning it was the first head mounted device (HMD) with dedicated controllers and scale tracking not to mention its new beastly specs following the DK2’s HDMI and USB combo with all new attached headphones and 2160 x 1200 OLED panel display and a good as hell 90hz refresh rate which is impressive as heeeckk.
	</p>
	<p>
	But from the shadows a company emerges to take the rains, HTC with their brand new HTC Vive a month after the CV1 with the same display as the CV1 meaning it was becoming a benchmark display which is nice :) it offered two display functions the same HDMI as previous devices but now offering DisplayPort functionality which was less common at the time but nice of HTC to include that along with classic USB 3.0 this time round it also had 90hz refresh rate meaning it was also becoming standard, for now at least.
	</p>
	<p>
	From now the timeline gets really muffled and annoying with new companies throwing their design in the ring and HTC’s endless amount of Pro, Cosmos and Focus series of headsets so I’m going to stick to main shockers and next one is the big one the one that changed the course of many companies focus on VR.
	</p>
	<p>
	the next headset in the timeline from oculus is the Oculus Go in 2018 was the first wireless VR headset ever created and because of this it had to be a joint effort of many companies but the main ones being Oculus, Qualcomm and Xiaomi. This was the first headset made with the Facebook Technologies Brand on it aka disgusting gross, the various companies who worked on this had their fair share and would continue to work with Oculus for their next mistake.
	</p>
	<p>
	The next headset developed by Oculus was the Oculus Rift S in 2019 which was partnered with Lenovo to develop the design, this headset rocked the world in every way it had inside out tracking which meant no more sensors because they built to the headset and all new gen2 oculus touch controllers which in my opinion look worse than the gen1 controllers but they work so I can’t complain, it had a lower refresh rate at 80hz which was annoying but was necessary for the fast switch LCD panels at 2560 x 1440 which was super nice to look at, at the time as of now it’s pretty bad.
	</p>
	<p>
	The Rift S was amazing for about 3 months until Valve the creators of Steam software made their own headset the Valve Index and it was sooo much better it had finger accurate controllers meaning you can flip people off in games and immediate leg up from oculus controllers :) it had a much better screen at 1440 x 1600 each eye meaning two panels each eye which was very nice it had base stations for tracking same as the vive series of headsets but in all it was super nice. In between those release dates in may oculus released something horrifying.
